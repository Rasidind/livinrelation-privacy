  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>LivinRelation</strong> (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, why we collect it, how we use and share it, how long we retain it, and how you can control it. By using the App you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Age restriction &amp; Children’s policy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for users <strong>aged 18 or older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18. If we become aware that a user under 18 has created an account, we will suspend or delete the account and remove the data as required.</p>
    <p><strong>Children’s policy:</strong> Parents or guardians who believe their child under 18 has registered should contact us at <a href="mailto:care@livinrelation.com">care@livinrelation.com</a>. We will promptly investigate and remove any such account and related personal data.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Data we collect &amp; purposes</h2>
    <p>We collect the following categories of data for the stated purposes:</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Category</th><th>Examples</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>

      <tr><td>Profile data</td><td>Bio, interests, photos/images, preferences, and profile fields listed below</td><td>Display in app, matching, profile browsing</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Messages &amp; UGC</td><td>Chat messages, shared images/media</td><td>Enable messaging and social features; moderation and safety</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Device &amp; usage</td><td>Device identifiers, IP address, OS version, app version, crash info</td><td>Analytics, debugging, improving the app</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Payment metadata</td><td>Payment token, transaction id (no full card data stored)</td><td>Process premium service purchases</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Profile fields collected (examples):</strong> name, email id, sex, age, mobile number, country/state/district, height, weight, body type, lifestyle (drink, smoke), marital status, have children, number of children, work type, work status, income, living situation, willing to relocate, relationship preference, nationality, qualifications, languages spoken, religion, ethnicity &amp; culture.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. How we collect data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Directly from you when you sign up, fill in profile fields, upload photos, message other users, or contact support.</li>
      <li>Automatically from your device during use (device info, IP address, error/crash logs).</li>
      <li>From third-party providers when you use social login (Google) or payment processors.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Location</h2>
    <p>We are <strong>not</strong> collecting location data at this time. If we add location-based features later, we will update this policy and ask for explicit permission before collecting precise location data.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Visibility &amp; sharing with other users</h2>
    <p>By default, profile photos and public profile fields are visible to <strong>everyone</strong> within the App. Messages are visible only to the conversation participants. We may use aggregated or anonymized information for analytics and product improvement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Messages &amp; Encryption</h2>
    <p>Chat messages are stored to provide messaging functionality. Messages are <strong>end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)</strong>, which means message content is encrypted between sender and recipient. We may process limited metadata (timestamps, sender/recipient IDs) for delivery and abuse investigation.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because media/files are stored to enable delivery, stored media will be encrypted in transit and at rest, and will be deleted according to the retention schedule below.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Third-party services &amp; processors</h2>
    <p>We use third-party providers to host and operate the App. Key providers include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> — Authentication, Firestore/Realtime DB, Cloud Storage for images.</li>
      <li>Payment processor for premium services — we do not store full card data; tokens and transaction IDs only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers process data on our behalf and under contract. Please review their privacy policies for details about their practices.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>10. Cookies, local storage &amp; analytics</h2>
    <p>The App may use cookies or local device storage for session management, preferences, and limited analytics. We do not use third-party advertising trackers. We do not currently use Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>11. How long we retain your data (Retention policy)</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Specific retention periods are:</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Data type</th><th>Retention period</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Account profile data (name, email, phone, profile fields)</td><td>Until you delete your account</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Chat messages and media</td><td>180 days by default from the date of creation; can be removed earlier if user deletes the message or requests deletion</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Payment metadata (tokens, transaction IDs)</td><td>7 years or as required by local tax laws if applicable</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Device logs, crash reports</td><td>365 days</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Backups and archived logs</td><td>90 days (deleted as permitted)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Support tickets and related correspondence</td><td>3 years</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>If you request account deletion, we will remove your live account and profile data within <strong>30 days</strong> and begin purging associated data according to the schedule above. Some data may persist longer where required by law or to prevent fraud and abuse (for example payment records or legal holds).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>12. Account deletion &amp; re-authentication</h2>
    <p>To delete your account: Sign in &gt; Settings &gt; Delete Account &gt; Confirm. For security we require re-authentication before deletion:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email/password:</strong> enter your password again.</li>
      <li><strong>Google sign-in:</strong> re-authenticate via Google OAuth.</li>
      <li><strong>Phone number:</strong> verification code via SMS required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After re-authentication and confirmation, we will remove access immediately and permanently delete live data within <strong>30 days</strong>. Backups and archived copies will be removed as permitted by our retention schedule.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>13. Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on applicable law, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:care@livinrelation.com">care@livinrelation.com</a>. We will respond within applicable legal timelines.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>14. Law enforcement &amp; legal requests</h2>
    <p>User data may be shared with law enforcement only if legally required. We do not provide user data to third parties without proper legal process. If we receive a legal request (court order, warrant, or similar) we will review it and, where permissible, notify affected users unless prohibited by law.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>15. International transfers &amp; storage</h2>
    <p>Even though the App will be released only in India, some of our service providers (such as Google Cloud / Firebase) may process or store data in other countries. By using the App you consent to transfer of information to countries outside India. We use appropriate safeguards when transferring personal data.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>16. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect personal data, including TLS for data in transit, access controls, and Firebase security rules for database and storage access. However no system is completely secure — if a data breach occurs we will notify affected users and authorities as required by law.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>17. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. We will indicate the "last updated" date at the top. Significant changes will be communicated in-app or via email to registered users where appropriate.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>18. Contact &amp; grievance</h2>
    <p>For privacy questions, support, appeals or to request export/deletion of data, contact: <a href="mailto:care@livinrelation.com">care@livinrelation.com</a>.</p>
